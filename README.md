## Introduction

This repo provides a simple reference / cheatsheet outline related to the field of Project Management (PM). I wanted a knowledge reference to jot down anything of interest related to PM. I ran with PMBOK® outline as it is an _Approved American National Standard_ recognised internationally and a copy of the Fifth Edition was sitting on my bookshelf. 

The PMBOK® or _A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge_[^1] lays out some guidelines for, you guess it, Project Management. Most companies these days have their own flavour of Project Management mythologies and are more or less an extension of the core processes outlined in this guide. I consider this guide as a good foundation to reference. I wanted layed it out so I could visually see the connections between the knowledge areas and process groups. 

This is basically a template or cheatsheet of the processes, inputs and outputs in a text based flat structure of the process flow diagrams provided in the guide. With the text files, I use the Obsidian text editor, which provides a graph view all the interactions at a local level (page level) or as wide as the overall guide level (all pages). You can also toggle the depth of links if you are keen.

These files are plain text files so one can move them about easily and opened with any text editor on any operating system. This is important to me as I have had issues with other proprietary based systems which lock up my content and is a bugger to get out. 

## Process Page Setup

I set up each page with the following structure. H1 stands for heading 1 and so forth. The Data Flow Diagrams in the Guide run from left to right: Input Processes > Process > Output > Output Processes. Using a text file format, I had to rotate it 90° to run top-down. 

H1 - Name of the Process 

H2 - Inputs into the Process

First - List of input Processes within a Knowledge Area
Second  - List of input Processes outside of the knowledge area / External to the Process

H2 - Outputs

- Bullet point(s) of the outputs from the process. 

First - List of output Processes connections within a Knowledge Area
Second  - List of output Processes connections outside of the knowledge area / External to the Process

Rest of the page blank for you to fill out. 

## What's New In 6th 

I based this outline on the fifth edition, and PMI published the [6th edition](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok) in 2017. I think the same principles remain. 

PMI provided this [video](https://youtu.be/KaFmtY18ykw) update on _What’s New in the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition?_
